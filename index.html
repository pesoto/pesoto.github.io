                <h2>Senior Economist</h2>
                <p>Welcome! I am a senior economist in the Industrial Output Section at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. My research and policy work leverages cutting-edge AI and natural language processing tools to quantify hard-to-measure economic phenomena—from firm-level uncertainty and AI adoption to supply chain bottlenecks and bank lending risks—delivering precise, real-time economic indicators and policy-relevant insights critical for economists, policymakers, and market participants. My research has appeared in leading academic journals including <em>Management Science</em>, the <em>Journal of International Economics</em>, and the <em>Journal of Financial Services Research</em>.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I am a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board, having joined in 2022. As part of the Industrial Output section, I work on the Federal Reserve Board's Expanded Measurement Agenda (EMA) where I leverage ML/AI techniques alongside novel data sources to develop measures of economic activity. I am also a <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/center-financial-research/research-fellows" target="_blank">Research Fellow</a> at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Previously, from 2018-2022, I was a financial economist at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), where I conducted banking research and developed quantitative models to support FDIC operations.</p>
                <p>I completed my PhD in Economics in July 2018 at Universitat Pompeu Fabra and the Barcelona School of Economics. My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley. During my doctoral studies, I collaborated with central banks, including an eight-month research visit at the Deutsche Bundesbank and research projects with the Banco de la República of Colombia. I also held internships in the credit analytics department at Moody's Analytics and various investment funds. Additionally, I taught courses in Text Mining and Financial Analytics as an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland from 2019 to 2023.</p>
                <p>Outside of economics and finance, my interests include artificial intelligence, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and improv comedy.</p>
