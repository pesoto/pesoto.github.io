                <h2>Economist</h2>
                <p>Welcome! I am a principal economist in the Industrial Output Section at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. My research develops high-frequency economic indicators from unstructured data using AI/ML techniques, with applications to financial intermediation, manufacturing, productivity, and labor markets. This work improves real-time measurement of economic and financial conditions, including uncertainty, investment dynamics, supply chain disruptions, and bank behavior. My research has been published in leading academic journals such as <em>Management Science</em>, the <em>Journal of International Economics</em>, and the <em>Journal of Applied Econometrics</em>, and has been featured in the <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>Fortune</em>, and speeches by Federal Reserve officials.</p>

        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I am a principal economist at the Federal Reserve Board, having joined in 2022. In the Industrial Output section, I work on economic measurement, including the estimation of U.S. industrial production and capacity utilization (the G.17), covering manufacturing, mining, and utilities. I also contribute to the Federal Reserve Board's Expanded Measurement Agenda where I use ML/AI techniques and novel data sources to develop high-frequency measures of economic activity. In addition, I am a <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/center-financial-research/research-fellows" target="_blank">Research Fellow</a> at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Previously, from 2018-2022, I was a financial economist at the FDIC, where I conducted banking research and developed quantitative models to support FDIC operations. While working at the FDIC and the Fed, I taught courses in Text Mining and Financial Analytics as an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland from 2019 to 2023.</p>
                <p>I received my PhD in Economics from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (the Barcelona School of Economics) in 2018, and hold a B.A. in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley. During my doctoral studies, I worked closely with various central banks, including an eight-month research visit at the Deutsche Bundesbank and research projects with the Banco de la República of Colombia. Earlier in my career, I held roles in credit analytics  at Moody's Analytics and in investment management. </p>
                <p>Outside of economics and finance, I am actively involved in artificial intelligence, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and live performance, including improv and theater.</p>
